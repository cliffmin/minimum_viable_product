Our curiosity and desire to see farther have generated two parallel stories: one reaching out into the depths of space and time, and the other reaching back down to our story here on Earth. “To Space & Back,” narrated by James May, explores the way each of us has been changed by the discoveries made by the international space program.

The telegraph system - the internet of the day - experienced such large induced currents in the wires that fires broke out in some offices. The Aurora Borealis extended south as far as Central America and was so bright that campers in the Rockies woke up in the middle of the night thinking it was dawn.

And while the bomb was being invented, babies were born, friendships were forged, and Los Alamos transformed into a community: one that was strained by words they couldn’t say, letters they couldn’t send, freedom they didn’t have. The Wives of Los Alamos is a novel that sheds light onto one of the strangest and most monumental research projects in modern history.

His intuitive, nonmathematical approach gives a wide audience its first real taste of how relativity works and why it is so important not only to science but also to the way we view ourselves as human beings.
